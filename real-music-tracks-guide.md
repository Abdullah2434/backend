## üéØ **How to Add More Real Music Tracks**

### **Method 1: Direct Database Insertion (Recommended)**

Create a script like this to add more tracks:

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
require("dotenv").config();

// Your new music tracks
const newMusicTracks = [
  {
    trackId: "track_high_002",
    name: "Upbeat Corporate Success",
    energyCategory: "high",
    s3FullTrackUrl: "https://your-real-url.com/track.mp3", // Real URL
    s3PreviewUrl: "https://your-real-url.com/track.mp3", // Same URL for now
    duration: 180,
    metadata: {
      artist: "Pixabay Music",
      source: "Pixabay",
      license: "Pixabay License",
      genre: "Corporate Instrumental",
    },
  },
  // Add more tracks here...
];

async function addMusicTracks() {
  await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI);

  // Add new tracks (don't clear existing ones)
  const insertedTracks = await MusicTrack.insertMany(newMusicTracks);

  console.log(`‚úÖ Added ${insertedTracks.length} new tracks`);

  await mongoose.connection.close();
}

addMusicTracks().catch(console.error);
```

### **Method 2: Using Your Music Upload API**

1. **Start your server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Use the upload endpoint**: `POST /api/music/upload`
3. **Upload real music files** with proper metadata
